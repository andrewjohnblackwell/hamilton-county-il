A screenshot.png file is required for the theme to display properly in WordPress admin.

Requirements:
- Filename: screenshot.png
- Dimensions: 1200x900 pixels (recommended)
- Format: PNG

3. The utility bar and main navigation
4. Quick links grid section
5. Welcome section with placeholder image
6. Footer with multi-column layout

To create the screenshot:
1. Activate the theme on a staging site
2. Set up sample content

4. Resize to 1200x900 pixels
5. Save as screenshot.png in the theme root

Alternative: Use a placeholder image temporarily with the theme name and "Hamilton County Child Theme" text.
